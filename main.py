"""main.py
Voice-only chat loop for Pi-5 AI Communicator.

Workflow:
    1. Record a short chunk of audio from microphone.
    2. Transcribe it with OpenAI Whisper.
    3. Feed transcription to command_handler.handle_command.
    4. Display the response (text).  You can later hook up TTS here.

Usage:
    python main.py

Press Ctrl+C to exit.
